# Disease Prediction System 🏥

An AI-powered disease prediction system that uses machine learning to predict diseases based on symptoms. The system employs an ensemble of models including Random Forest and Neural Networks to provide accurate predictions with confidence levels.

## 🌟 Features

- **Multi-Model Prediction**: Combines Random Forest and Neural Network predictions
- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly interface for symptom selection and result display
- **Detailed Analysis**: Provides disease descriptions, precautions, and confidence levels
- **Real-time Processing**: Instant predictions with smooth animations
